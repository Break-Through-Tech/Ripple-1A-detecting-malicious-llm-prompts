## 🎯 The Challenge
### Project Summary
In this project, you will use a labeled dataset of benign and adversarial text prompts (prompt-injection and jailbreak attempts collected from public repositories) and NLP text-vectorization (TF-IDF and word embeddings) with supervised classifiers in scikit-learn and a feedforward neural network in Keras to build a model that detects and flags malicious prompts before they reach a production LLM. This will help our company address the growing security risk of LLM-powered applications being manipulated into leaking data, bypassing safety controls, or executing unintended instructions.

### Success Criteria
A working classifier evaluated with precision/recall/F1 and a confusion matrix, with explicit attention to the false-negative cost (a missed attack is worse than a false alarm), benchmarked against a baseline (e.g., logistic regression vs. the neural net), plus a short analysis of failure modes and dataset bias.

### Stretch Goals

This project has several natural stretch goals that add depth without breaking the free-Colab / no-API-key constraints:

- Multi-class attack categorization. Move beyond binary (malicious vs. benign) to classify type of attack — direct injection, role-play jailbreak, instruction-override, obfuscation/encoding-based, etc. This adds a meaningful labeling and class-imbalance challenge.
- Transformer-based embeddings. Upgrade from TF-IDF to pretrained sentence embeddings (e.g., a small Sentence-Transformers model) for feature extraction, then compare performance against the classical baseline. Runs on free Colab and teaches transfer learning intuitively.
- Adversarial robustness testing. Have the team generate simple perturbations of known attacks (synonym swaps, spacing tricks, leetspeak, base64-style encoding) and measure how much detection degrades — a hands-on lesson in why security models need adversarial evaluation.
- Explainability layer. Add token-level attribution (e.g., LIME/SHAP or attention/coefficient inspection) so the model can show why a prompt was flagged — turning a black-box classifier into something a security team could actually trust.
- Bias and fairness audit. Test whether the classifier disproportionately flags benign prompts in certain languages, dialects, or topic areas, connecting directly to the fairness/bias-mitigation skills from ML Foundations.
- Lightweight guardrail demo. As a capstone, wrap the final model in a simple input-filtering function and show it intercepting attacks in a mock prompt pipeline — a tangible, presentable artifact without needing any live LLM or API key.

These are sequenced roughly easiest-to-hardest, so a fast-moving team can keep climbing while a team that needs more time still lands a complete core deliverable.

### Project Milestones
Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a GitHub Projects board to track tasks within each milestone.

| Month | Milestone | Key Activities |
|---|---|---|
| September | Threat Modeling & Data Foundation | Business understanding (threat model: what is prompt injection vs. jailbreak), data consolidation, EDA, and preprocessing/labeling reconciliation. |
| October | Feature Engineering & Baseline Models | Feature engineering (TF-IDF, embeddings), baseline classical models in scikit-learn, evaluation metric selection. |
| November | Neural Modeling & Error Analysis | Feedforward neural net in Keras, model selection across candidates, error analysis and bias/fairness review. |
| December | Final Evaluation & Delivery | Final evaluation, documentation, GitHub repo cleanup, and presentation. |

> **Note for the team:** Please create a GitHub Projects board in this repository to break these milestones into weekly tasks. Go to the **Projects** tab → **New project** → Choose **Board** → Add columns for each month.
